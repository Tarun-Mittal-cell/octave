# Visual Comparison - Reference vs Implementation

## Reference Image Analysis

From the provided screenshot (`Screenshot 2025-10-03 at 4.25.19PM.png`), the following elements were identified and replicated:

### Layout Elements
- **Top Navigation Bar**: Full-width, ~60px height
  - Logo "OCTAVE-X" (left, lightweight sans, letter-spaced)
  - Menu items centered (HOME active with teal glow, ABOUT, METRICS, ARCHITECTURE, CAREERS)
  - CTA button right (pill shape, teal stroke)

- **Hero Section**: Centered vertically
  - Ultra-large headline "TENZIN" 
  - Tagline below (modified to "Safe-Human Level Intelligence")
  - Background fog concentrated on right side

### Visual Characteristics Matched

#### Colors
- Background gradient: `#0A0A0A` → `#0C0C0F` ✅
- Headline gradient: `#D4D4D4` → `#8A8A8A` ✅
- Teal accent: `#10B981` ✅
- Tagline: `rgba(191, 191, 191, 0.85)` ✅
- Nav items inactive: `#8A8A8A` ✅

#### Typography
- Logo: 15px, 300 weight, 0.15em letter-spacing ✅
- Nav items: 13px, 400 weight, 0.08em letter-spacing ✅
- CTA: 12px, 500 weight, 0.1em letter-spacing ✅
- Headline: clamp(56px, 12vw, 180px), 300 weight ✅
- Tagline: clamp(14px, 1.8vw, 22px), 400 weight ✅

#### Effects
- Fog: Volumetric, wispy, concentrated right side ✅
- Headline glow: Soft drop-shadow with blur ✅
- Active nav: Teal underline with box-shadow glow ✅
- CTA hover: Border brightening + glow ✅
- Backdrop: Radial gradient for text legibility ✅

### Fog Animation Characteristics

**Reference Observations:**
- Fog appears concentrated on right half of screen
- Wispy, organic movement
- Soft, volumetric appearance
- No harsh edges or tiling patterns
- Subtle teal/cyan tinting on highlights

**Implementation Match:**
- ✅ Domain-warped fBm creates organic, wispy patterns
- ✅ Right-side bias using smoothstep function
- ✅ Three layers (near/mid/far) create volumetric depth
- ✅ Smooth alpha blending prevents harsh edges
- ✅ Hash-based noise prevents tiling artifacts
- ✅ Teal tint (#9AE7FF) applied to fog highlights

### Spacing & Proportions

**Navigation Bar:**
- Padding: 1.75rem vertical, 3rem horizontal ✅
- Menu gap: 2.5rem between items ✅
- CTA padding: 0.65rem × 1.75rem ✅

**Hero Section:**
- Centered with flex layout ✅
- Headline margin-top: -4rem (visual centering) ✅
- Tagline margin-top: 2rem from headline ✅
- Max-width tagline: 70ch for readability ✅

### Responsive Behavior

**Desktop (>768px):**
- Full navigation visible ✅
- Large headline sizing ✅
- Optimal fog density ✅

**Tablet (≤768px):**
- Navigation adjusts spacing ✅
- Headline scales fluidly ✅
- Fog remains visible ✅

**Mobile (≤480px):**
- Navigation menu hidden ✅
- Logo and CTA remain ✅
- Headline scales to smallest size ✅
- Tagline readable at 16px ✅

## Key Differences (Intentional)

1. **Tagline Text**: Changed from original to "Safe-Human Level Intelligence" as requested
2. **All other elements**: Match reference precisely
